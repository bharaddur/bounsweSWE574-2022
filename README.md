Steps to Fulfill lecture Instructions
-----

### Week1:

<em> Due Date: 8.03.2022 </em> 

1. Create a GitHub repository.
2. Include the GitHub repository on our course gitlab.
3. Modify the readme part of your repository to describe the nature of your repository.
4. Customize the “issues” by specializing them, such as the types and colors of tags.
5. Create issues and assign them to yourself.
6. Create a page to document the following research you will perform:
    • Study git as a version management system. There are many guides and videos you can watch. I recommend Git For Ages 4 And Up (https://youtu.be/1ffBJ4sVUb4). It is long, but very good.
    • Examine Wikidata (https://www.wikidata.org). Perform some tests with its API.
    • Document what you have learned by creating a research section of your GitHub repository. Use Wiki Markdown language and use your own words!
